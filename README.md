# Mathematical Python

*[Mathematical Python](/)* is an introduction to mathematical computing including:

* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks, markdown and $\LaTeX$
* Basic [Python](https://python.org/) programming: datatypes, logic, loops and functions
* Scientific computing with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* Applications in calculus, linear algebra and differential equations

## Prerequisites

We assume the reader has completed undergraduate courses in:

* Differential calculus: derivatives of elementary functions, Taylor series and optimization
* Integral calculus: Riemann sums, sequences and series
* Linear algebra: vector and matrix operations, systems of equations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors
* Differential equations: Euler's method for first order equations, linear systems of ODEs
