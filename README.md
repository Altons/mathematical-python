# Mathematical Python

[Mathematical Python](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~pwalls/math-python/) is an introduction to mathematical computing with Python, SciPy and Jupyter Notebooks. Interact links in the book lead to these notebooks.


## To Do

1. Update about page with:
    * learning goals
    * prerequisites
    * nbgitpuller links
2. Add section on indentation
3. Change example in Python > Functions > Keyword Arguments to not use text formatting.
4. Add section on lambda functions.
5. Add section on loop tables in Python > Loops section
6. Add calculus application in Python > Loops section since it's currently all number theory.
7. Provide a reference for Python > Loops > Exercise 10.
8. Write sections on SciPy, SymPy, and pandas.
9. Add opening and closing `---` for Theorems.
10. Write more examples and exercises for bisection method.
11. Write more examples and exercises for secant method.
12. Add optimization to Roots and Optimization.
13. Write exercises for Trapezoid Rule.
14. Add applications of numerical integrtation.
15. Check linear algebra with scipy for consistency with scipy.linalg and numpy.
